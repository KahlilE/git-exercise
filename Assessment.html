    <h3>Here are some of my favorite places to visit:</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>
            <h4>Central Park</h4>
            <p> It's a beautiful place and one of my favorite sceneries throughout all of New York.</p>

        <li>
            <h4>Times Square</h4>
            <p> I enjoy the lights and the energy everyone gives off in Times Square. It's never boring at it never fails to put a smile on my face.</p>
